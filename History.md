## v0.27.1

- Nova uses now React 15.3.x with associated Node modules, besides it prevents unknown prop warnings ([React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/unknown-prop.html)). We still depends on `react-meteor-data` and mixins to load data (thanks @MHerszak for careful watch!), we may move soon to Apollo (contributions welcomed on `[apollo](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/apollo)` branch).
- README updated. On deployment recommandations: you should go with Mup 1.0.3 ([repo](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-up)), MupX is not compatible with Meteor 1.4 ; on 3rd-party packages section, you can now upload images to a CDN ([package](https://github.com/xavcz/nova-forms-upload)).
- The 404 Not Found route has been brought back to `nova:base-routes`, you can customize its shape by editing `Error404.jsx` (`nova:base-components`).
- Added support for a custom CSS class for `SubscribeTo` component.
- No more global variable in `nova:api` (the last one? \o/).
- Fix a version problem with `fourseven:scss`, now running on 3.9.0.
- Remove unnecessary NPM dependency on `load-script` (thanks @MHerszak!).
- You can now run Nova in Brazilian Portuguese by [adding this package](https://github.com/lukasag/nova-i18n-pt-br) (thanks @lukasag!).
- Added support for a `defaultValue` property in `nova:forms`. You can define it in your custom fields, it will be added if no value nor prefilled value is defined (thanks @beeva-franciscocalle!).
- Fixed edge bug when users don't have an `username`, use `displayName` instead (thanks @jeffreywyman!).

## v0.27.0

- Remove Telescope global variable.
- Update to Meteor 1.4.
- A user can now subscribe to any collection with `nova:subscribe` package ([docs](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/master/packages/nova-subscribe)) and a reusable `SubscribeTo` component (thanks @schabluk!).

## v0.26.2

- Made component names more consistent; Collection names (‚ÄúPosts‚Äù, ‚ÄúComments‚Äù, etc.) are **always plural** in component names.
- Routes now live in their own package (`nova:base-routes`).
- The search now searches in the `excerpt` field, not `body`, because `body` is not published to the client (and searches would give different results on client and server). 
- Removed option to manually set a post's author. 
- The Embedly thumbnail feature now includes a "clear thumbnail" link to remove it and an option to enter a URL manually. 
- There is now an autofill tags component you can optionally include and use with `meteor add nova:forms-tags` (see Embedly package custom fields for how to use custom components in forms).
- You can now see a post's ID and stats in the post edit form if you're an admin.
- Fixed bug (I hope?) where daily view would become messed up when client and server were on different timezones.
- Now showing a user's posts on their profile page. 
- Added soft delete for comments (thanks @justintime4tea!).
- Fixed posts notifications bugs. 
- Got rid of a lot of Meteor packages in favor of NPM equivalents.
