## v0.5.2

* Added notifications of new comments and new replies for all users (along with unsubcribe link) and notifications of new posts for admin users.

## v0.5.1

* Added a second `createdAt` timestamp. Score calculations still use the `submitted` timestamp, but it only gets set when (if) a post gets approved.

* Started keeping track of versions and changes.
