// Material-UI breakpoints
// These are defined to be the same as Material-UI's breakpoints, ie, those
// documented in https://material-ui.com/layout/breakpoints/ . When we turn
// CSS into JSS, these map straightforwardly (unlike legacy LW breakpoints and
// Vulcan breakpoints, which are at weird pixel amounts.)
//   xs  extra-small  0px or larger
//   sm  small        600px or larger
//   md  medium       960px or larger
//   lg  large        1280px or larger
//   xl  extra-large  1400px or larger - this is customized
//
// FIXME: We want it to be the case that size-ranges are exclusive and
// exhaustive, ie, there is no size in between "small" and "medium" which is
// both small and medium or neither small nor medium. Since window sizes can
// be floats on some devices, we want to partition the range into a half-open
// interval, <960px and a closed interval, >=960px. Unfortunately, the syntax
// requierd to do this is a recent addition to CSS, Media Queries Level 4, and
// our SCSS->CSS compiler does not understand the new syntax. So the best we
// can do is to have small be <=959 and medium be >=960, creating a one-pixel
// trap where zoomed and high-DPI browsers can get themselves a broken render.
//
// You might think we could shrink this to a fraction of a pixel by making that
// <=959.99px, but Chrome, at least, unhelpfully rounds that up. So it looks
// like we can only fix the fractional-pixel size glitch by waiting for our
// SCSS compiler to fix its parser upstream.
