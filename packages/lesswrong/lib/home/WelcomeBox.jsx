          <p>This is a closed beta of the new Lesswrong with imported posts from the original Lesswrong site. </p>
          <p>
            While the domain-name is temporary, the content is not. If the new codebase is approved by the users, weâ€™ll be merging content from the two domains and having lesswrong.com point to the new site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the new LessWrong to discuss rationality, global catastrophic risk and other important issues that you care about with the other closed-beta users. And please let us know if you have any suggestions or feedback by using the chat button in the bottom-right corner of the page!
