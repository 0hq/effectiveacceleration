  <p><em>Commenting guidelines:</em></p>
  <p>
    <b>Aim to explain, not persuade.</b> Write your true reasons for believing something, as
    opposed to the reasons you think are most likely to persuade readers of your comments. Try to
    offer concrete models, make predictions, and note what would change your mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Try to be clear, on-topic, and kind.</b> Keep your comments accurate and clear. Focus on
    the question at hand. And when you criticize someoneâ€™s point, consider doing so
    <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/dy/supportive_scepticism_in_practice/">
    supportively</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Be curious.</b> Approach disagreements with curiosity; focus on understanding other people
    rather than proving them wrong. Try to figure out the truth together.
