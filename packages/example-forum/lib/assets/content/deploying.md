Once you've played around with Vulcan, you might want to deploy your app for the whole world to see. 

We recommend using [Meteor Up](http://meteor-up.com/) to deploy to a [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) server, along with [Compose](http://compose.io) to host your database. Another good solution is [Galaxy](http://galaxy.meteor.com/).

Learn more in the [Vulcan docs](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/deployment.html).
