### Removing Getting Started Posts

If you're ready to insert your own content and want to delete these getting started posts, comments, and users, you can do so with a single command.

Open a new [Meteor shell](https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteorshell) and type:

```js
Vulcan.removeGettingStartedContent()
```

See you on the other side!
