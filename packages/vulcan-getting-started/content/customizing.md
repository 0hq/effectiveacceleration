If you want to learn how to customize Vulcan, we suggest checking out the [docs](http://docs.vulcanjs.org). 

The first things you'll want to do are probably create a `settings.json` file to hold all your settings, and then taking a look at the sample custom package by uncommenting `customization-demo` in `.meteor/packages`.

Here are two tutorials to get further:
* [Understanding the Vulcan Framework](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/tutorial-framework.html )
* [Customizing & Extending Vulcan](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/tutorial-customizing.html)

Happy hacking!
