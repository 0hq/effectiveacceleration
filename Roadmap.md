# Roadmap

Some of the improvements planned for the next versions of Telescope. Email [hello@telesc.pe](mailto:hello@telesc.pe) if you think you can help with any of this!

[Fixing issues](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues) is also a great way to pitch in :)

- Get rid of default user account dropdown. 
- Better user profiles. 
- Better user dashboard (with search).
- Implement real reactive joins.
- Add list of users participating in a thread. 
- Improve post pagination.
- Improve subscriptions management. 
- Refactor CSS with layout/visuals/colors separation.
- Improve the invite system. See [#253](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues/253).
- Make a package to send a email newsletter containing the top X posts of the day/week/month.
- Use [Autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/) package for `post_edit` and `post_submit` forms.
- Support @mentions.
- Support following other users. 
- Improved tag system with hierarchical and user-defined tags.
- Auto-post from RSS feed.
- Auto-post from Twitter.
- Use text-based URL slugs (i.e. `site.com/12345/this-is-a-post-title`)
- Improve settings panel (multiple sections, better help text).

## Package Ideas

These are things that won't be supported by Telescope's core, but would make good ideas for packages.

- Image Upload (ability to upload an image or file with each post).
