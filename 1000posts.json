I needed a better theory of evidence, which I got from \u0026quot;A Technical Explanation of Technical Explanation\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;The Conservation of Expected Evidence.\u0026quot; Bayes + my traditional probability training started working their way into my mind, so I could evaluate different evidential claims much better than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso important was \u0026quot;Occam's Razor.\u0026quot; I had never seen a technical definition of Occam's Razor provided, and I was suddenly floored by the outright wrongness of arguments like, \u0026quot;God is the simplest explanation for the universe.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere's more to the story than that. After all, changes like this never have one true cause. I began to see the disconnect between my thoughts about morality (\u0026quot;I have to admit that homosexuality is wrong\u0026quot;) and my feelings about it (\u0026quot;But I can't feel like my gay friends are really bad people\u0026quot;). I started getting kind of disgusted by the sheer number of bad Christian arguments parroted about like it was nothing. The entire time I was studying economics, which I put a lot of stock in, and theories about interest rates being evil, the necessity of Christian governance, and so on, all started to look less and less like God's wisdom and more like the same old ignorance that every society has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this feeling of disgust that forced me to finally admit I didn't consider myself a \u0026quot;Christian\u0026quot; anymore, and the arguments I had gathered in my mind in the mean time that led me to fill the gap with \u0026quot;atheist.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is all relatively recent, so it is in much better detail than the other influences. Surely there must have been something in my brain that led me to be able to reject Creationism long before I ever considered myself a \u0026quot;rationalist.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n","baseScore":30,"inactive":true}

The truth is that I am either lucky or unlucky on this issue, depending on how you look at it. I am not very overconfident. Modesty comes naturally to me. Asserting my opinions makes me uncomfortable. When someone else says I'm wrong, I take it very much to heart. This is just my personality. When I was younger I was more assertive, but as I've gotten older I find that my uncertainties have grown. Probably learning the rational truth on these matters has contributed to the change, but it is one which has come naturally to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people are different, but they can still know that their overconfidence is irrational and mistaken, without particularly acting any less confident.

I've had no success arguing against these people, and one of the things that impressed me most the first time I read Overcoming Bias was that it was a community of people who used consequentialist arguments without fumbling for excuses, who thought Torture Vs. Dust Specks was a real problem instead of just \u0026quot;It would be wrong to inflict either of those options on people, so it's not a moral issue\u0026quot; (which is what my old philosophy professor said when I mentioned it to her).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don't think Overcoming Bias ever officially argued for consequentialism, but a book aimed at the general public might have to. Eliezer is one of the most persuasive writers I've ever read, and if I thought his book could convince my friends to think consequentially I would be recommending it even more than I would otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n","baseScore":13,"inactive":true}

Including states a bit confused about consistency itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit more of a personal example would be a state I sometimes recall having been in in the past, and have certainly seen in others, would be when one might say something like, oh, I dunno, \u0026quot;and scientifically, the universe is about 13.7 billion years old and earth is about 4.5 billion years old\u0026quot; and of course, the world was created about 6000 years ago.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs near as I can tell, happens is that we almost imagine the \u0026quot;scientific world\u0026quot; and the \u0026quot;religious world\u0026quot; as parallel universes that... are actually the same one, so mentally we keep track of it by keeping track of different things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way this works is someone might manage to end up in a state that they completely fail to really face the question of \u0026quot;okay, but if you rewind time a bit, will you see 6000 years ago the universe poofing into existence, or can you go farther back, etc? ie, what \u003cem\u003eACTUALLY\u003c/em\u003e happened in \u003cem\u003eACTUAL REALITY\u003c/em\u003e?\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, when facing that question, all sorts of Escher mentality stuff starts forming as a defense. But what I think initially happens, at least in part, is sort of mentally tracking those as being about different subjects, rather than contradictory statements about the same thing. So that one will end up, with \u0026quot;science glasses\u0026quot;, visualizing prehistoric humans doing stuff tens of thousands of years ago, while etc etc etc...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, that's my own, partly introspective model of what's going on here, of how people can end up in these states.\u003c/p\u003e\n","baseScore":7,"inactive":true}

Thus, your remarks here --\n\n\u003eI tried to explain that if you say, \"People are bad,\" that means you believe people are bad, and if you say, \"I believe people are nice\", that means you believe you believe people are nice.

Or perhaps it is something else.  Perhaps she has no idea what the actual cause is, or perhaps she thinks she does, but she doesn't really.  But none of this implies that she was attributing to herself the belief that people are nicer than she actually believes them to be (where, here, I'm using \"belief\" in your sense.)\n\nHer utterance seems analogous to someone who walks out of an optometrist's office after having his pupils dilated and says, \"Because of those drops the optometrist gave me, I believe the sun is brighter than it really is.\"  If we heard this, we shouldn't conclude that he believes something contradictory, or that he has incorrect beliefs about his beliefs.

He does not mean to imply that he has any *wrong* beliefs (in the conventional sense).  It would be a mistake to say that his subjective experience of the light is in any way erroneous.  After all, it accurately reflects the fact that he had those drops put in his eyes.\n\nSimilarly, your interlocutor's statement that she \"believes\" that people are nicer than they really are referred to a particular quality of her emotional attitude towards them, not to a belief (in your sense) about how they are.  In particular, it didn't imply any expectation about how they would behave.  *That*, I expect, is why she was initially taken aback when you asked, \"So, are you consistently surprised when people undershoot your expectations?\"  The problem wasn't, as you appear to think, that she had prevented her own mind from drawing obvious conclusions.  The problem was that you (because of her confusing wording) were speaking of her so-called \"belief\" as though it were a belief in the normal sense, something that should lead to certain expectations about other peoples' actions.

I'm not sure there is a good solution, as it is almost impossible to know whether or not you are in the grip of some irrationality.\n\nTo give an example, it is conceptually easy to kill germs - bacteria simply can't handle wide swings in humidity, temperature, acidity, etc.  Washing hands with soap and hot water, cooking food, using bleach, etc. are easy ways that are guaranteed to kill bacteria.

I'll go out on a limb and assume that I was being incomprehensible, even though I'll be digging myself in deeper if that wasn't the reason...\n\nIn classical game theory (subgame-perfect equilibrium), if you eat my chocolate, it is not rational for me to tweak your nose in retaliation at cost to myself. But if I can first commit myself to tweaking your nose if you eat my chocolate, it is no longer rational for you to eat it. **But**, if you can even earlier commit to definitely eating my chocolate even if I commit to then tweaking your nose, it is (still in classical game theory) no longer rational for me to commit to tweaking your nose! The early committer gets the good stuff.\n\nEliezer's arguments have convinced me that a better decision theory would work like Vladimir says, acting as if you had made a commitment in all situations where you would like to make a commitment.
