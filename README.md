Telescope is an open-source, real-time social news site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com)

**Note:** Telescope is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)

# Running Telescope on Heroku
- Use the [Heroku buildpack for Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite) to push to Heroku: `heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack https://github.com/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite.git`

# Running Telescope on EC2
- Check out [Dirk Krause](https://gist.github.com/dirkk0)'s [installation script for EC2](https://gist.github.com/4530915).

# First Run
- Set the root URL variable used for Twitter auth (on Heroku: `heroku config:add ROOT_URL=http://your_url`)
- Set the mail URL variable used for email notifications (for example, with [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) on Heroku: `heroku config:add MAIL_URL=smtp://postmaster%40YOUR_DOMAIN.mailgun.org:YOUR_PASSWORD@smtp.mailgun.org:587/`)
- Fill in your Twitter keys (by clicking on "Sign Up/Sign in" in your Telescope top bar)
- The first user account created will automatically be made admin
- Check out the settings page and fill out basic things like the site's name

# Local Variables
Meteor uses local environment variables for a few things, such as configuring email. While this is straightforward to do on Heroku (see above), on a local dev environment the best way is to set up an alias for the `mrt` command. 

For example, to configure Meteor to use Mailgun for email, in your `.bash_profile` file just add:
`alias m='MAIL_URL=smtp://username:password@smtp.mailgun.org:587/ mrt'`


This can also be useful for starting Meteor on a specific port:
`alias m4='MAIL_URL=smtp://username:password@smtp.mailgun.org:587/ mrt --port 4000'`
