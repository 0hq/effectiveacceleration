# Welcome to the code behind the EA Forum

The EA Forum is a synced fork of [LessWrong](https://github.com/LessWrong2/Lesswrong2).

## Contributing

We have not prioritized writing a guide to the tech. You can see the instructions on the LessWrong repo, but any given sentence is more likely than not to be out of date and misleading. If you are at least moderately interested in contributing, message [JP](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/jpaddison). I won't mind the inquiry, and can help you out and in the process might update this readme.

We do not use github for issues. Please [contact us](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/contact) with bug reports.
